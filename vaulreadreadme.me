# Vault Secret Reader Pipeline

## Description
This Jenkins pipeline demonstrates secure secret retrieval from HashiCorp Vault using Jenkins credentials. The pipeline uses a REST API call to fetch secrets stored in Vault.

## Pipeline Components

### Environment Configuration
- Sets up Vault server address: `http://vault:8200`

### Pipeline Stages
1. **Read secret from Vault**
   - Authenticates with Vault using Jenkins credentials
   - Retrieves a specific secret using Vault's HTTP API
   - Processes the response using `jq` to extract the key value

## Prerequisites
- Jenkins server with pipeline support
- HashiCorp Vault server running and accessible
- Jenkins Credentials Plugin installed
- `curl` and `jq` installed on Jenkins agent
- Vault token stored in Jenkins credentials with ID 'vault-jenkins-token'

## Configuration Requirements

### Jenkins Credentials
- Credential ID: `vault-jenkins-token`
- Type: Secret text
- Content: Vault authentication token

### Vault Configuration
- Vault server running on port 8200
- Secret path: `jenkins/my-secret/data/jenkins/my-secret`
- Proper permissions set for the token

## How It Works
1. Pipeline starts and sets the Vault server address
2. Retrieves the Vault token from Jenkins credentials
3. Makes an HTTP GET request to Vault with proper authentication
4. Extracts the secret value using jq
5. Returns the secret value for further processing

## Security Notes
- Uses Jenkins credential store for secure token management
- Implements proper HTTP headers for Vault authentication
- Ensures secure communication with Vault server
- the vault need to be unsealed first with 3 out of 5 unseal token that the owner got

## Error Handling
The pipeline includes:
- Proper exit code handling from shell commands
- Trimming of response to remove whitespace
- Secure credential handling through Jenkins withCredentials block

## Usage
1. Create the Jenkins pipeline using this code
2. Configure the required Jenkins credentials
3. Ensure Vault server is accessible
4. Run the pipeline to retrieve secrets
